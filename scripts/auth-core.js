    bodyHtml:`
      <p>When people search for a wellness brand, they want to know where a product comes from, how it reaches them, how they can contact the company, and whether the brand explains its purpose clearly. Ozylix presents a direct-to-consumer supplement experience built around its own factory-to-home story: products are introduced through the Ozylix storefront and delivered through the company’s online ordering journey.</p>
      <p>Ozylix’s public catalogue includes effervescent vitamins, spirulina products, moringa products, and other nutraceutical formats. The factory-to-home message gives that catalogue a clear customer journey: discover a product, read its information, place an order, and receive it through Ozylix’s support and delivery process.</p>
      <h3>What “factory to home” means</h3>
      <p>“Factory to home” describes Ozylix’s intended direct customer journey, not a promise about every delivery route or order. The company’s public information presents an Indian manufacturing story and a direct online storefront. Customers should still read the product label, order confirmation, shipping policy, and support information for the details that apply to their purchase.</p>
      <p>A company story is only one part of a purchasing decision. Readers should also check the product name, serving instructions, ingredient list, allergen information, storage guidance, batch or lot information, and the contact details printed on the packaging. People who take medicines, are pregnant or breastfeeding, have a medical condition, or are preparing for a procedure should discuss supplement use with a qualified healthcare professional.</p>
      <p>Explore the <a href="/about">Ozylix About page</a>, browse the <a href="/shop">current product range</a>, review the <a href="/faq">FAQs</a>, or <a href="/contact">contact the team</a> with a product or order question.</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Dietary supplements are not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always follow the product label and current website terms.</p>` },

    bodyHtml:`
      <p>Anand, Gujarat is part of Ozylix’s public identity. The brand’s website presents Ozylix as a direct-to-consumer wellness brand and identifies Anand as the location associated with its manufacturing story. For customers, the location matters because origin is one of the first questions people ask when they compare supplement brands online.</p>
      <p>A manufacturing story is most valuable when it goes beyond a photograph or a slogan. It should explain the relationship between the facility, product format, quality checks, packaging, and customer support, while distinguishing what is verified from what is aspirational. Ozylix can build trust by keeping that explanation specific and current.</p>
      <h3>From location to process</h3>
      <p>“Made in India” gives a product an origin, but it does not by itself explain how a product was formulated, tested, packed, stored, or shipped. Customers should use the product page and packaging to review ingredients, serving information, warnings, storage instructions, and other details relevant to the specific product.</p>
      <p>Effervescent products are designed to be dissolved in water before consumption. That creates practical questions about moisture protection, tube closure, serving instructions, and storage. The most useful manufacturing communication answers those questions using the product label rather than making broad statements about absorption or guaranteed results.</p>
      <h3>A quality story is a documentation story</h3>
      <p>Ozylix’s public site uses phrases such as FSSAI licensed, lab tested, and third-party tested in its company narrative. Those phrases should always be read together with the exact licence or testing documentation and the scope of the claim. A facility approval is not the same as approval of a medical treatment, and a supplement should not be presented as preventing, treating, or curing a disease.</p>
      <p>Visit the <a href="/about">About page</a> for company information, use the <a href="/shop">Shop</a> for current availability, or <a href="/contact">contact Ozylix</a> with manufacturing or product questions.</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Consumers who take medicines or have health concerns should speak with a healthcare professional before using a new supplement.</p>` },

    metaDescription:"Use this practical checklist to compare effervescent vitamin supplements in India, including labels, storage, support, and product information.",
    bodyHtml:`
      <p>Effervescent supplements are designed to be dissolved in water before they are consumed. The format can be convenient for people who prefer a drinkable routine, but convenience should not replace careful product selection. Before buying an effervescent vitamin supplement in India, compare the label, company information, instructions, storage requirements, and support available after purchase.</p>
      <h3>Start with the product label</h3>
      <p>The label is the most important source of information for a specific supplement. Check the product name, serving size, ingredient list, quantity per tube or pack, directions for use, storage instructions, warnings, manufacturer or marketer details, and batch information. If a product is intended to be dissolved in water, follow the stated volume and preparation instructions.</p>
      <p>A company webpage can provide context, but it should not contradict the packaging. If the online description and label differ, contact the company before using the product. Product information, safety, quality, and possible interactions are important considerations when evaluating a dietary supplement.</p>
      <h3>Look for a clear company identity</h3>
      <p>A supplement brand should make it reasonably easy to identify who is responsible for the product and how customers can ask questions. Ozylix provides public routes for shopping, FAQs, and customer contact. That information is a useful starting point for checking whether the company explains its products and policies consistently.</p>
      <h3>Do not choose by exaggerated promises</h3>
      <p>Words such as “instant,” “miracle,” “guaranteed,” “cures,” or “works for everyone” should prompt caution. Dissolving a product in water does not by itself prove a particular absorption speed or outcome. A better approach is to ask whether the format fits your routine, whether you can store the tube as directed, and whether the ingredients are appropriate for you.</p>
      <p>Browse the <a href="/shop">Ozylix effervescent range</a>, read the <a href="/faq">FAQs</a>, and <a href="/contact">contact the company</a> if you need help understanding a product label.</p>

    bodyHtml:`
      <p>People shop for supplements for different reasons: some prefer an effervescent drink, some look for a plant-based format, and others want to compare a particular ingredient or serving routine. Ozylix presents a range that includes effervescent vitamins, spirulina products, moringa products, and other nutraceutical formats. The exact formula and suitability of each product depend on its individual label.</p>
      <h3>Effervescent formats</h3>
      <p>Effervescent products are dissolved in water before consumption. This can make the routine feel different from swallowing a conventional tablet or capsule. Follow the product’s directions for the amount of water, serving frequency, storage, and use after opening.</p>
      <h3>Plant-based formats</h3>
      <p>Spirulina and moringa are plant-based ingredients that appear in parts of the Ozylix range. Category language is not a substitute for checking the full ingredient list, allergen information, serving details, or dietary suitability of a particular product. Customers following a strict dietary pattern should check the label and contact the company when needed.</p>
      <h3>Choose by information, not promises</h3>
      <p>The most useful question is not “Which product is best for everyone?” It is “Which product information matches my needs, routine, and professional guidance?” Read the label, compare the current product page, and avoid claims that promise guaranteed transformation or disease treatment.</p>
      <p>Use the <a href="/shop">Ozylix Shop</a> for current availability, learn more on the <a href="/about">About page</a>, and review the <a href="/faq">FAQs</a> before ordering.</p>

      <p>Shopping direct from a brand is easiest when the company identity, product information, ordering flow, delivery terms, and support route are easy to find. Ozylix’s customer journey is designed around moving from the company’s factory-to-home story to an online storefront where customers can review products and place orders.</p>
      <h3>Check the product before ordering</h3>
      <p>Start with the product page and packaging information. Review the ingredient list, serving size, directions, warnings, storage guidance, pack quantity, price, and any terms that apply to the product or promotion. If you have a health condition or take medicines, speak with a healthcare professional before using a new supplement.</p>
      <h3>Review delivery and returns</h3>
      <p>Delivery promises and return terms can change, so use the current Ozylix website and order confirmation as the source of truth. Check the delivery address, dispatch information, estimated arrival, and return or replacement conditions before completing an order. If a shipment arrives damaged or incorrect, contact the company with the order details and photographs where appropriate.</p>
      <h3>How Vita Points fit into the customer journey</h3>
      <p>Ozylix presents Vita Points as a customer rewards programme in its public campaign material. Customers should review the current programme terms for how points are earned, when they become available, how they can be redeemed, and whether exclusions or expiry rules apply.</p>

// BODY SCROLL LOCK — one owner, self-healing
//
// THE BUG THIS KILLS
//   Several overlays lock page scrolling while they are open. The mobile
//   hamburger menu does it the heavy way — body{position:fixed;
//   top:-scrollY; overflow:hidden} — which is the only reliable way to
//   stop touch-scroll on Android. The side cart, auth and "more" drawers
//   did it the light way (overflow only). The close functions did not
//   match the open functions: only closeAppMenu cleared position:fixed;
//   the others cleared overflow alone. So if the menu was open and
//   ANYTHING closed it by another path — a link that forgot
//   closeAppMenu (the WhatsApp item did), a navigation, a tab switch —
//   body stayed position:fixed forever. The result on a phone is exactly
//   "nothing scrolls and no button works": the page is pinned at a fixed
//   offset and looks dead, even though taps still fire underneath.
//
//   There was no safety net: showPage() never cleared the lock, so once
//   stuck it stayed stuck across every navigation.
//
// THE FIX
//   One unlock function that clears EVERY property the locks set and
//   restores the scroll position by reading it back out of body.style.top
//   (so it needs no shared variable and heals a lock set by any path).
//   It is called by every close function, by showPage() on every
//   navigation, and on pageshow — so the body can never stay frozen
//   after the user navigates or returns to the tab.
function unlockBodyScroll() {
  var b = document.body;
  var wasFixed = b.style.position === 'fixed';
  var y = wasFixed ? -parseInt(b.style.top || '0', 10) : null;
  b.style.position = '';
  b.style.top = '';
  b.style.left = '';
  b.style.right = '';
  b.style.width = '';

  if (wasFixed && y != null && !isNaN(y)) window.scrollTo(0, y);
}
window.unlockBodyScroll = unlockBodyScroll;

// Every layer that can cover the page, in one list so nothing can be
// missed again. These are the only elements in the document that take a
// scroll lock, so "is one of these open?" is the same question as "is the
// body legitimately locked?".

];

// Two open-markers exist in this document: the older drawers use `.open`,
// the shop filter drawer uses `.is-open`. Both count. Miss the second one
// and the watchdog below tears the filter drawer's scroll lock off within
// a second of it being set, letting the page scroll behind an open drawer.

// THE BUG THIS KILLS
//   showPage() unlocked the body but left every drawer sitting there with
//   its .open class. The page changed underneath while the cart drawer
//   stayed painted over the whole screen — and because the drawer's dark
//   overlay is a full-viewport fixed element, it swallowed every tap aimed
//   at the bottom nav behind it. Tapping "Cart" then "Account" on a phone
//   did nothing at all: the second tap never reached the button.
//
//   Classes are stripped directly rather than by calling closeSideCart() /
//   closeAuth() etc, because those carry side effects — closeAuth() writes
//   a "login prompt dismissed" flag — that must not fire on every single
//   navigation. This is idempotent and safe to call as often as we like.

// THE WATCHDOG — the guarantee, not just another patch
//   Every fix above closes one known path to a stuck lock. This closes all
//   the unknown ones. If the body is locked but nothing that locks it is
//   actually open, the lock is orphaned by definition and the page is dead
//   for no reason — so release it. Any future overlay that forgets to
//   unlock, any close path nobody thought of, heals within a second
//   instead of leaving the customer on a frozen store.

  // What changed and why:
  //  • The old ping sent {device, ts, attribution}. The server destructured
  //    only {session_id, page, referrer, city} — so device and attribution
  //    were thrown away, and because referrer was NEVER sent, every single
  //    visitor was filed as "Direct" in the admin panel.
  //  • It re-pinged every 4 minutes but the server dropped a session after
  //    2 minutes, so visitors vanished for half of every visit and the
  //    "Active Now" number was roughly half the real figure.
  //  • Single-page navigation was invisible: the ping fired once on load,
  //    so a shopper who browsed 8 pages counted as 1 pageview.
  // This sends the full picture and re-pings inside the server's window.

// vitaLeadCaptured/VITA_SYSTEM were referenced everywhere below but never
// declared, and vitaAddMsg/vitaShowTyping/vitaHideTyping/vitaAddChips/
// vitaRenderRecs were called but never defined — every one of those was an

// VITAMATCH — rule-based recommender

// The Gemini chat below is metered, and when the quota runs out the
// advisor page stops doing the one thing it exists for. This does the
// same job with a scoring table: four questions, ranked against the real
// catalogue, no network call and no tokens, so it cannot go down.
//
// Products are matched on TAGS AND NAME TEXT, never on hardcoded ids.
// PRODUCTS is synced from the backend and ids change; a rule that says
// "anything tagged immunity, or with amla or ashwagandha in its name"
// keeps working when the catalogue does.
//
// Wording is deliberately non-clinical — "commonly chosen for", never
// "treats" or "helps with" a condition. Same FSSAI/ASCI line the chat's
// system prompt holds, and the same disclaimer is shown with the result.

- Keep replies short (2-4 sentences) and conversational, suitable for a chat bubble.
